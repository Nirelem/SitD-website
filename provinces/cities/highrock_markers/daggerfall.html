        <p style="text-align: justify;">Daggerfall is the capital of the region of Glenumbra. 
            It serves as the seat of power for the Kingdom of Daggerfall, one of the five major kingdoms in High Rock
            By virtue of its age, prosperity, and prominence, it was considered 
            the de-facto capital of High Rock by the Third Empire.
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>Architecture & Layout: </b> Daggerfall is a large walled city built at the top of a tall, steep hill that towers over the coast but gradually 
            inclines down into the forests to the northeast, specifically on the north side of a bay at the southernmost 
            point of Glenumbra, around where the Iliac Bay meets the Eltheric Ocean.
            The city is typical of Breton design, featuring stone buildings with steep, sloped roofs, 
            reflecting their medieval European inspiration.
            The city is divided into several districts but the most important are Castle Town,
             the Harbor District, and the Trade District. 
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>Politics:</b> The city is the political heart of one of the most powerful factions in High Rock. The rulers of Daggerfall 
            often wield significant influence over the politics of the Iliac Bay region. Historically, the throne has been held by the 
            Imperial-supporting royal family. Over the course of its long history, the kingdom of Daggerfall has often been at war with
            the kingdom of Sentinel in Hammerfell, across the Iliac Bay. Daggerfall thrives as a coastal city due to trade.
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>Quick History: </b>The city of Daggerfall was a major location in <i>Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</i>. In the game, the ghost of
            King Lysandus haunted the city's streets at night with a horde of undead spirits, screaming vengeance as they terrorized the populace.
            Lysandus' spirit would only be soothed when the player character avenged the king by killing his murderer. This laid Lysandus' spirit
            to rest, and the curse over Daggerfall was lifted. </br>
            During the <a href="../../../lore/warpinthewest.html">Warp in the West,</a> which took place
            during the conclusion of <i>Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall,</i> The Kingdom of Daggerfall was a major faction involved in the event, and it was one of 
            the five major Breton kingdoms that emerged after the Warp.
