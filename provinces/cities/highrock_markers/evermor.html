    </div>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Evermore, sometimes spelled Evermor, is a city on the banks of the Bjoulsae River in eastern High Rock, 
        located near the border with Hammerfell.
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Its impressive palace was assembled from slabs of granite quarried from nearby Markarth. 
        The city is strategically located along the only land route that connects High Rock to the rest of the 
        continent of Tamriel.
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Historically, the Bretons of Evermore ruled over the region of Bangkorai. These lands were subject to 
        frequent attacks from the <a href="../../../lore/reachmen.html"> Reachmen</a> of the mountains, who asserted their birthright to the city and 
        aimed to reclaim their ancestral homeland. Because Southern Bangkorai is considered a region of 
        Hammerfell, Evermore's rulership is often contested by the Redguards of <a href="../hammerfell_markers/sentinel.html"> Sentinel</a>. Evermore's position 
        along trade routes spanning to the rest of Tamriel allowed it to become an important trading hub. 
        Locally, it linked eastern High Rock, the southern and central regions of Hammerfell, <a href="../hammerfell_markers/orsinium.html"> Orsinium</a>, and 
        western Skyrim, while more distant trade routes to the southeast connected it with Cyrodiil.
        </br>
        </br>
        
        <b>Quick History: </b>
        Before the<a href="../../../lore/warpinthewest.html"> Warp in the West,</a> it was one of eight kingdoms in High Rock, though the aftermath of the Warp 
        would see Evermore as one of only five remaining Breton Kingdoms in High Rock.
