    <p style="text-align: justify;">Camlorn is one of the five major Breton kingdoms in the province of High Rock, 
        situated on the coastal highlands of Glenumbra. Camlorn and the surrounding region 
        is a melting pot of several different Breton cultures and its people fancy themselves 
        as more refined and metropolitan compared to their neighbors in Daggerfall. 
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is a large, walled-off city. The city itself 
        is placed on a tall hill that is scalable only from the south. The city's outskirts 
        are largely rocky and have few open plots of land, as it all descends north into the coast.
        There is at least one farm outside of the city, next to the sewer entrance.
        </br>
        </br>
        Camlorn's city gate has a courtyard that connects to three different districts of Camlorn, 
        Temple District, the Castle District, and a third smaller district with several homes. 
        The city has a northern quarter that is very affluent and contains the 
        local Prostitutes Guildhouse, a grand palace. There is 
        a path behind the castle that goes outside the walls and onto a cliffside that overlooks the 
        Eltheric Ocean and a wide, rocky promontory called Cavilstyr Rock.
