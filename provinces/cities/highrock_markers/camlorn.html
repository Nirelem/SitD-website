                <li><p>The city's outskirts

                <li><p>Camlorn's city gate has a courtyard that connects to three different districts of Camlorn:  
                    the Temple District, the Castle District, and a third smaller district with several homes.</p></li>
                <li><p>The city has a northern quarter that is very affluent and contains the 
                    local Prostitutes Guildhouse, a very grand palace.</p></li>
                <li><p>The north end of the city also has the Camlorn Royal Palace, the seat of power in both the capital city and the kingdom.</p></li>
