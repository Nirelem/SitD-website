        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Wayrest is a major city in the center of the Stormhaven region of High Rock, 
        at the mouth of the Bjoulsae River. It serves as the capital of Stormhaven, a kingdom that 
        forms one of High Rock's regions.
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is split into seven districts. The Residential District lies in the 
        northern part of the city. The Merchant District and Market Square lie west 
        of the river and south of the Residential District. The Temple and Palace Districts 
        are off to the west, while the Banking District can be found in the east. To the south, 
        on the banks of Iliac Bay, sit Wayrest Docks.
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Wayrest has always been seen as a rival to Daggerfall, which was already well 
        established when it first was founded as a sleepy fishing village at the mouth of the Bjoulsae River 
        in 1E 800. Wayrest prospered greatly after the fall of the first Orsinium in the 1st Era when the commerce
         of all of Tamriel began to pass through its gates. Wayrest was granted the right to call itself a 
         kingdom in 1E 1100. Today the city can boast the largest and richest population in High Rock.
        </br>
    </br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/warpinthewest.html">Warp in the West,</a> which took place
        during <i>Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall,</i> Wayrest was a major faction involved in the event, and it was one of 
        the five major Breton kingdoms that emerged after the Warp.
