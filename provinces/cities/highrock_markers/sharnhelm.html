                <li><p>Shornhelm is located in the tumultuous landscape of the Kurallian Mountains in north High Rock, 
                    which is known for its rough, tricky terrain and oppressive environment, one that many people 
                    find hard to survive in.</p></li>
                <li><p>The city is built on a hill that overlooks the entire central region 
                    and it even boasts a strong defensive parameter of high walls and watchtowers.</p></li>
                <li><p>Shornhelm is 
                    split between two districts, the lower city where the common folk dwell and trade with one 
                    another, as well as the upper city, where the nobility live.</p></li>
                <li><p>The upper district has a manor for each of the noble houses, 
                    as well as the local barracks.</p></li>
                <li><p>The city's substructure is a series of interconnected cisterns that connect to each of the 
                    city's water wells, like a honeycomb of pocketed caches.</p></li>
                <li><p>Some of them have leaked into each 
                    other after years of exposure and their shoddy craftsmanship.</p></li>
                <li><p>The one that distributes the most 
                    water is sometimes called the master source, that bridges an underground river to the rest of 
                    the system. The sewers also serve as the city's outlaws refuges. </p></li>

                <li><p>Shornhelm was once the seat of 
                    power for the Kingdom of Rivenspire, and it was aptly ruled by the Riven-King.</p></li>
                <li><p>If no monarch 
                    is present, then the regency council, the Council of the North takes over.</p></li>
                <li><p>It is a triumvirate 
                    of the kingdom's three major houses, Dorell, Montclair, and Tamrith.</p></li>    
                <li><p>The city acquired the 
                    epithet of the "Crown City of the North" for its status. </p></li>
