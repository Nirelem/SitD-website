    <p style="text-align: justify;">Shornhelm (sometimes spelled Sharnhelm) is one of the nine historical Breton kingdoms in the 
        province of High Rock, located in the center of Rivenspire. Shornhelm was once the seat of 
        power for the Kingdom of Rivenspire, and it was aptly ruled by the Riven-King. If no monarch 
        is present, then the regency council, the Council of the North takes over. It is a triumvirate 
        of the kingdom's three major houses, Dorell, Montclair, and Tamrith. The city acquired the 
        epithet of the "Crown City of the North" for its status. 
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Shornhelm is located in the tumultuous landscape of the Kurallian Mountains in north High Rock, 
        which is known for its rough, tricky terrain and oppressive environment, one that many people 
        find hard to survive in. The city is built on a hill that overlooks the entire central region 
        and it even boasts a strong defensive parameter of high walls and watchtowers. Shornhelm is 
        split between two districts, the lower city where the common folk dwell and trade with one 
        another, as well as the upper city, where the nobility live. Each of the noble houses has a 
        manor in the district, as well as the local barracks and even the local wayshrine.
        
        The city's substructure is a series of interconnected cisterns that connect to each of the 
        city's water wells, like a honeycomb of pocketed caches. Some of them have leaked into each 
        other after years of exposure and their shoddy craftsmanship. The one that distributes the most 
        water is sometimes called the master source, that bridges an underground river to the rest of 
        the system. The sewers also serve as the city's outlaws refuges. 
    </br>
</br>
        Shornhelm is neighbored by several settlements, including Markwasten Moor to the southeast, 
        Old Gate to the northeast, and White Haven to the west.
