                    of the ocean and the beaches that surround it.</p></li>
                <li><p>The landscape around the city consists of grassy 
                    plains with privately-owned farmsteads and large rocky outcrops between the coast and the river 
                    in southern Boralis. </p></li>
                <li><p>At the walled city's center is a large fountain and the seat of power, Dorell Manor.</p></li>
                <li><p>Northpoint's three main roads disperse toward  
                    the western gate, the southern gate, and 
                    Lanthorn, which is the cty's signature lighthouse.</p></li>
                <li><p>South of Dorell Manor is the city's graveyard and along the southern walls are large towers.</p></li>

                <li><p>Their expansion was careful to avoid confrontation with the
