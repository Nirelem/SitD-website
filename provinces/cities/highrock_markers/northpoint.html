    <p style="text-align: justify;">Northpoint (also spelled as North Point) is one of the nine historical Breton kingdoms in 
        the province of High Rock, located on the northeast point of Rivenspire. Northpoint is an 
        important trading center along the northwest trading route on the Eltheric Ocean, as well 
        as the seat of power for House Dorell, one of the three 
        major houses of Rivenspire. Their power extends across northern Rivenspire, including farmland 
        around the city and beyond the sea. As of 3E 432, Northpoint was one of five major 
        kingdoms in High Rock.
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Northpoint is located at a very strategic point in Rivenspire. It hosts the only port in the 
        entire region, where the Eltheric Ocean meets the Great Bay. Northpoint 
        sits at the top of Dore Elard, a mountain that overlooks the coast and provides a grand vista 
        of the ocean and the beaches that surround it. The landscape around the city consists of grassy 
        plains with privately-owned farmsteads and large rocky outcrops between the coast and the river 
        in southern Boralis. 
    </br>
</br>
        At the walled city's center is a large fountain and the seat of power, Dorell Manor. From there, 
        Northpoint's three main roads disperse toward Lanthorn, the western gate, and the southern gate. 
        South of Dorell Manor is the city's graveyard and along the southern walls are large towers. 
        Some of the city's biggest buildings are located in the center, including the inn and the smithy, 
        and further out are manor houses and average homes. The marketplace is located along the 
        northeastern wall of the city.
    </br>
</br>
        Shornhelm is neighbored by several settlements, including Markwasten Moor to the southeast, 
        Old Gate to the northeast, and White Haven to the west.
    </br>
</br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Historically, Northpoint was a city ruled by the Barons of House Dorell, a major faction that 
        swore fealty to the Kingdom of Rivenspire seated in Shornhelm. By the late Third Era, however, 
        Northpoint was recognized as a fully-fledged kingdom in its own right, separate from its equal, Shornhelm.
        When the <a href="../../../lore/warpinthewest.html"> Warp in the West</a> took place in 3E 417, the kingdom of Northpoint took advantage 
        of the chaos to claim territory around them, and emerged as one of the five major Breton kingdoms after the Warp. 
        Their expansion was careful to avoid confrontation with the 
        kingdoms of the Iliac Bay (Daggerfall and Wayrest) or even Skyrim's forces in the post-<a href="../../../lore/warofbend'rmahk.html">War of 
        the Bend'r-mahk.</a>
