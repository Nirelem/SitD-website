    <p style="text-align: justify;">Jehanna is one of the historical Breton kingdoms in the province of High Rock, situated on the icy shores of the Northern Coast. 
        Nestled in the snow-covered forests of the Western Reach, it is described as being "as beautiful as its name".
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Jehanna lies on the northeast coast of High Rock, right near the border of Skyrim, in a generally 
        northern biome. An isolated dock that bore Jehanna's name was nestled between the base of Mount Sorrow, 
        the tallest peak of Wrothgar. It sat at the end of a lightly-forested valley and lay on the Sea of Ghosts, 
        near the Druadach Mountains. The Jehanna Road is a major roadway that runs near the Bjoulsae River in 
        Bangkorai and rolls northeast into the Wrothgarian Mountains.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>For most of its early history, the land that makes up the core of Jehanna was mostly underdeveloped and 
        ignored. It started out merely as a small, isolated dock just east of Farrun. It was only in 2E 864 that
        the name Jehanna started appearing as a mark on maps of High Rock. In the late 3rd Era, during the  
        <a href="../../../lore/warofbend'rmahk.html">War of the Bend'r-mahk</a>, 
        the lands of Jehanna had fallen under the control of Skyrim. Currently, the state of the kingdom and the city are
        unclear at best, but most assume that the lands are considered to be a disputed territory between High Rock and Skyrim.
