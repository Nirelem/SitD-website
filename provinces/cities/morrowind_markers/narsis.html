    <p style="text-align: justify;">Narsis is one of the eight major cities on the mainland of Morrowind.
        The city is historically known as the ancient capital of the former
        great house of Hlaalu, which has 
        been replaced with the Great House Sadras. 
        From this city, they reign over west-central Morrowind.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is located in a river basin centered around 
        Lake Hlaalu, where it can be found on its south shore.
        It is built on a hillock that overlooks the lakefront 
        to the north, and at the top of it lies the local 
        kinhouse. However, the hill has a stone foundation 
        built around it, providing ample space around it and 
        elevation above the rest of the settlement. The city 
        is surrounded by low-barring walls and much of the 
        landscape is uneven ground; as a countermeasure, 
        these hills are surrounded by stone platforms 
        like under the kinhouse.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Early in the Fourth Era, House Hlaalu was stripped 
        of its position as a Great House and removed from 
        the Grand Council of Morrowind, with its position 
        and holdings transferred to the new House Sadras.
