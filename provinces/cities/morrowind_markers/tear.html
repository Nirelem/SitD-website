    <p style="text-align: justify;">Tear is one of the eight major cities on mainland Morrowind. 
        It is the capital city of the Great House Dres.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The Tear region is notably hot and humid, given its 
        proximity to Black Marsh and the greater Dres District, 
        which mainly sweeps across the province's southern borderlands.
        Tear is the epicenter of a series of plantations, which
        are walled-off and heavily guarded by Dres spearmen.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Tear is the capital of the Great House Dres, whose 
        sphere of influence revolves around an agrarian 
        agricultural society, building its vast fortune from 
        the export of saltrice and its grip on the slavery industry.
        Tear is also known as the Jewel of the East and it 
        is the most open to trade and commerce compared to 
        other cities on the mainland.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>When Red Mountain erupted in 4E 5, the ground around Tear 
        turned into mush and the swamp essentially swallowed up 
        half the city. Earthquakes tore through the ground and 
        caused water to spill in until people were knee-deep in 
        muck water.
        One year later, in 4E 6, the <a href="../../../lore/argonians.html"> Argonians</a> would launch their invasion
        of Morrowind. The Dunmer have been enslaving Argonians for millennia, 
        but House Dres in particular cemented themselves as the linchpin of 
        the Argonian slave trade. One can only imagine what must have happened
        in the capital city of Dres, so close to the border of Black Marsh,
        when the Argonians invaded.
