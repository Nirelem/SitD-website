    <p style="text-align: justify;">Balmora was one of the four cities of the district of 
        Vvardenfell. It was known primarily as the district seat of 
        power for the former great house of Hlaalu, which has 
        been replaced with the Great House Sadras. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city was the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, 
        only behind the temple-metropolis, Vivec City. The 
        city was built on the banks of the Odai River, in 
        the midst of a great valley. Much of the land that 
        surrounds the city is rocky scrubland, natural stone 
        menhirs, and green hills, and provides little 
        flatland for other people to settle on.
        <br><br>
        The city itself is split into three districts. 
The Commercial District is found on the western 
side of the river. Labor Town, on the east side 
of the river is the general residential district. 
Finally, the High Town district is on the 
northwestern hill that looms over the city.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>In 4E 5, Red Mountain erupted and 
        ravaged most of Vvardenfell. A month later, relief 
        efforts were sent to the settlements of Vvardenfell
        and it was subsequently rebuilt and re-inhabited.
