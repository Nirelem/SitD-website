    <p style="text-align: justify;">Necrom is one of the eight major cities on the mainland of Morrowind,
        and is perched on the Padomaic Ocean, right on the eastern edge of
        the Padomaic Crest. The city is most known for its massive
        Necropolis and complex crypts. It is called City of the Dead because it
        is where most Dark Elves go to commune and worship their family ancestors.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Necrom is a dense cityscape built on a steep, mountainous island, 
        surrounded by perilous cliffs, and at the mouth of the river that 
        divides the southern Telvanni Peninsula region.
        Necrom's architectural style is noted for its lofty walls and white towers.
        The Necrom outskirts comprise of steep hills and winding roads 
        strewn up and across the small river valley around it.
        The city's layout is like an intertwined web that meets at several points.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>The city is under the rule of Great House Indoril.
        While most modern Dunmer have left their ancient customs behind, Necrom helps 
        them re-connect with that lost part of their history and their ancestry.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Morrowind in the Fourth Era has experienced a great change in its religion.
        After the fall of the Living-Gods, taking place after the events of<i> Elder 
        Scrolls III: Morrowind</i>, the New Temple reverted to the old deities that
        the Dunmer used to worship before the rise of the Living-Gods. With Necrom's 
        strong ties to the Dunmer faith, it is unknown exactly how this recent schism
        has affected the city.
