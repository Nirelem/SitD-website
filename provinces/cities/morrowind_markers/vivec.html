    <p style="text-align: justify;">Vivec City was the largest city in Vvardenfell before 
        its destruction. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>It was situated on the island's 
        southern coast in Norvayn Bay, with the moonlet 
        Baar Dau floating above. The city was a collection of 
        nine artificial islands; each island was a separate 
        district or canton and was made up of a large 
        multi-tiered building the size of a small town. 
        The many bridges and walkways between these cantons 
        created a maze that could be intimidating for new 
        arrivals. Water was the dominant element in the 
        architecture, present even inside.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>The entire city of Vivec was considered a holy 
        place, as it was home to the Living God Vivec 
        himself. The city was policed by special guards 
        drawn from the militant order of the Temple, the 
        Ordinators.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Occuring sometime after <i>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>,
        Baar Dau, the floating moonlet suspended over the city, crash landed and 
        completely destroyed Vivec City upon vicious impact. The force caused by the 
        collision set off a chain reaction in the land and resulted in the eruption of
        Red Mountain, which ended up destroying almost all of Vvardenfell.
