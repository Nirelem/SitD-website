    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ald'ruhn WAS one of the four cities on the 
        district of Vvardenfell. It served as the 
        district seat of power for the Great House 
        Redoran. The settlement was built around the 
        carcass of Skar, an ancient Emperor Crab that 
        was slain by the united tribes. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The surrounding land is inhospitable for the 
        common-folk; it is riddled with steep hills, 
        dead wood, and jagged rocks, and not much can 
        be found beyond the city limits. Even so, the 
        community of Ald'ruhn had always lived through 
        the harsh environment, from the ash storms to 
        the sparse grazing. Much like other House 
        Redoran townships, the city was built in the 
        typical Redoran village style, with organic 
        curves and undecorated exteriors reminiscent 
        of the environment. 
        <br><br>
        There were three principal districts in Ald'ruhn. 
There was Ald'ruhn Town, the outer-half of the city. 
The second district was the Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar, 
which was built inside the Emperor Crab's shell. 
Finally, the third district was Fort Buckmoth, which housed 
a garrison of Imperial Legion soldiers and acted as 
Ald'ruhn's first line of defense.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Unfortunately, in 4E 5, Red Mountain erupted and 
        ravaged most of Vvardenfell. A month later, relief 
        efforts were sent to the settlements of Vvardenfell, 
        but it is unknown how Ald'ruhn fared during this time, 
        or if it recovered at all. However, due to it being 
        located near the foot of Red Mountain, it is very 
        likely that the fate of the city has been sealed.
