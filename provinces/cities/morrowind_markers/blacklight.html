    <p style="text-align: justify;">Blacklight is one of the eight major cities on the mainland
        of Morrowind, situated on the northwest point of the
        province, near the Velothi Mountains.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The town has hedge mazes in its parks and the city 
        harbors are marked by wharves and piers.
        The city's region and its neighboring borderlands 
        has been riddled with bandits and thieves since the 
        early First Era, and are usually held up in caves
        throughout the mountains.
        <br><br>
        Blacklight is most well known as the capital of the Great 
House Redoran, whose values revolve around the virtues 
of maintaining honor and persevering through hard-work 
as a valiant warrior.

        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Since the provincial capital, Mournhold, was sacked by 
        the <a href="../../../lore/argonians.html">Argonians</a>, in their invasion of Morrowind in 4E 6 after the
        eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5, Blacklight has 
        become the new capital and the Council of Great 
        Houses have been held in the city. The city of House Redoran
        was chosen because it was the Redoran army that held back and 
        drove off the invading Argonians.
