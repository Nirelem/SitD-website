    <p style="text-align: justify;">Windhelm, the City of Kings, also known as "Ysgramor's city", is a city in northeastern Skyrim 
        close to the border with Morrowind and is the only substantial city in the hold of Eastmarch.
        The ancestors of the Nords came from a lost northern continent called Atmora. They would migrate down to 
        Tamriel and found the city of Saarthal in Skyrim. But this city was sacked and razed by the native <a href="../../../lore/falmer.html"> Snow Elves</a>.
        In response to this terrible atrocity, Ysgramor and his Five Hundred Companions would sail from Atmora and conquer
        all of Skyrim from the Snow Elves. He would then found the city of Windhelm, on a site where he could
        gaze upon the hill of his son's burial mound, and decreed that the city would be a "monument to the glories of mankind".
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Captive Snow Elf slaves were forced to build the city, using the Atmoran architectural style of their captors. It is 
said that as many elves died during Windhelm's construction as were killed by the Companions before arriving at the 
site. Ysgramor's palace, the Palace of Kings, towers over the city, a symbol of man's dominion. Beneath the city
is an elaborate maze of tombs and catacombs.
<br><br>
<b>Politics: </b>The ancient city holds a very heavy weight over the Nordic culture. Not only is it the oldest human settlement in
the continent, it was also the old capital of the First Nordic Empire, and the Palace of Kings was the seat of many
of Skyrim's greatest High Kings. 
<br><br>
<b>Quick History: </b>During the events of <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, Windhelm was the center of the Stormcloak Rebellion against
the Cyrodiilic Empire. When the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html"> Great War</a> ended and the White-Gold Concordat signed, Windhelm was perhaps
the last bastion where people could freely worship Talos, the founder of the Empire and the God-Hero of Mankind.
