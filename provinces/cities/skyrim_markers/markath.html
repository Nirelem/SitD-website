    <p style="text-align: justify;">Markarth (translated as "Above the Karth" in the Reach language) is one of the nine major cities in the 
        province of Skyrim. It is known colloquially as the "City of Stone". Markarth was founded on the abandoned 
        remains of the <a href="../../../lore/dwemer.html"> dwarven</a> city, Nchuand-Zel.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Markarth is nestled in a river valley in the Druadach Mountains. It is a former Dwarven city built through a large 
        stone crag, intricately designed around the cliffs and waterfalls from the environment. The city's layout is built
        into the mountain of Karthmad, dividing the city into two districts. 
        <br><br>
        The northern end is Dryside, and has streets that ascend 
        above each other with well-refined homes, while the main square and marketplace lie below.
        The city's southern end is the Riverside, the basin populated by the lower-class and the bustling silver mines. 
        These districts meet each other at either end of the city: at the main gates on the east side, and at the city's palace
        on the west side. As the districts approach the palace, they ascend high towards the top of the crag and 
        arrive at Understone Keep, the Jarl's palace that contains the Mournful Throne, the seat of power in the Reach. 
        <br><br>
        The precipices between the keep and the Riverside contain the city's smithy and other important places,
        like the local crypt and the Markarth Ruins. There is an ornate temple on the highest peak of the crag that
        contains the local chapter of the House of Dibella (Goddess of Beauty). 
        Underneath the crag are the slums of Markarth, known as the Warrens, which is a collapsed hallway 
        with campfires bearing minimal light. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Since the region is poor farmland, Markarth is mainly a mining-settlemnt that has a vast influx of silver veins 
        in the mountain. The city is the focal point of power throughout the region. It is often disputed over 
        between the <a href="../../../lore/reachmen.html"> Reachmen</a> and the Nords.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Whoever sits as the Jarl of Markarth will always be at war with the native Reachmen,
        for whomever controls Markarth controls the Reach. During the Skyrim Civil War, which took place in <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, the city
        of Markarth was aligned with the Cyrodiilic Empire.
