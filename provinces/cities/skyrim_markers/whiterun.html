        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whiterun is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, serving as the capital 
        of Whiterun Hold and its vast open tundra.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Whiterun is situated between the White River and the grassy tundra of Whiterun Hold, 
        an open expanse that reaches as far as the eye can see. The city's site consists of vast acres
        of fertile land, and so the city is surrounded by multiple farms. The city is well-fortified; 
        the road into the city is a fortified hill with three layers of gate and the rest of the city 
        is surrounded by a thick stone wall laden with small watchtowers.
        <br><br>
        The city is separated into three districts, based on their elevation. 
        The Plains District is Whiterun's center of commerce. The Winds District is the city's 
        residential area. At the center of the 
        district, a small park that circles around a sacred tree called the Gildergreen, which is associated
        with the nearby Temple of Kynareth (Goddess of the Sky). On the east side of the park is the historical 
        mead hall Jorrvaskr, which also serves as the 
        headquarters of the Companions, a group of warriors who take on private and public contracts 
        for the people of Skyrim.
        The highest tier in Whiterun is the Clouds District, where not many people get to often. 
        The only thing here is the Jarl's seat of power, Dragonsreach, which stands mighty above everything 
        across the hold. It looms over the city from atop a long stairway.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Politics: </b>Whiterun is found in the heart of Skyrim, and because of 
        this, it is the center of trade across the province. 
        Whiterun is home to the Companions, a legendary warrior group of great renown, known throughout all of Skyrim for their deeds of valor.
        The city is the site of the mythical forge known as the Skyforge, where the arms and armor of the Companions are made. 
        The Jarl traditionally rules from a crystalline 
        throne in the palace named Dragonsreach, which overlooks the entire city.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the Skyrim Civil War, which took place in <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, the city
        of Whiterun would remain neutral in the war, until the intervention of the player character.
