    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dawnstar (also known as Danstrar) is a settlement on the northern coast of Skyrim, 
        and the hold capital of the Pale. It was once a garrison town, which served as an 
        exile post due to the cold harsh climate and notorious gales. The settlement 
        seemingly got its name due to its reputation for "greeting the sun as it begins 
        its journey".
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout:</b>The city has two mines, Iron-Breaker Mine and Quicksilver Mine, which supply iron 
        and quicksilver respectively. It is home to many fishermen and is an important port.
        An ancient <a href="../../../lore/darkbrotherhood.html"> Dark Brotherhood</a> sanctuary, Tamriel's most infamous assassins 
        guild, is located beneath the city. 
        The White Hall, a large longhouse located in Dawnstar, is the seat of the Jarl of 
        the Pale.
        The Tower of Dawn, also called Nightcaller Temple, is a ruined military fort 
        often used as a place of worship and sits upon a cliff top overlooking the town. 
        A small lighthouse sits atop a hill just east of town.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Because of the glacial icefields just to the east, it is the last port before 
        Windhelm that is not icebound following the Great Collapse. Its economy is 
        driven by its two mines.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the Skyrim Civil War, which took place in <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, the city
        of Dawnstar was aligned with the Stormcloak Rebellion. 
        The once abandoned Dark Brotherhood sanctuary 
        would become inhabited once again. It would serve as the last refuge for the 
        crippled guild of assassins, as all their other sanctuaries have been destroyed.
