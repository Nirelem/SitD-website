    <p style="text-align: justify;">Solitude is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, situated on the highland 
        bluffs of Haafingar Hold. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Layout & Architecture: </b>Solitude is one of Skyrim's largest cities, as well as one of its key ports, built on a natural 
        landmark known as the Great Arch. The busier sections of Solitude, 
        such as the crowded harbors on the coast, are built underneath the Great Arch, next to the Karth River. 
        Because of the uneven terrain outside of the city walls, there 
        is very little room for private land for farms.
        <br><br>
        The road leading up to Solitude's entrance is heavily defended by layers of gates and fortifications. 
        Solitude contains a unique style of architecture only seen in 
        Haafingar, consisting of rounded architecture and pointed roofs. The upper city's western district is known 
        as the Well District. To the north, on the mountainside 
        is Castle Dour, the city fortress that contains the Temple of the Eight Divines and the Emperor's Tower. 
        The city's eastern district, known as the Avenues District is the residential area, known for its 
        regal and grandiose streets. The Bards College, the Hall of the Dead, and the seat of power, the 
        Blue Palace are located here. 
        <br><br>
        Both the east and west sides are separated by an arching bridge that 
        connects the Castle Dour to the Windmill, one of Solitude's most iconic landmarks. Its wind power is 
        used to open the massive warehouse that is stored underneath the mountain.  
        There is a vast cavern underneath the mountain that is currently used by the East Empire Company as 
        one of their largest warehouses.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Solitude is currently the capital of Skyrim.
        The city is a major trading capital in the Sea of Ghosts, with an 
        expansive and illustrious history that gives it its prominent political power. It is the home 
        of the Bards College, an institute that preserves the ancient Nordic traditions of music 
        and story-telling. Solitude is the Imperial seat of power in Skyrim and 
        has been the most influenced by Imperial culture since the union of King Mantiarco and Queen 
        Potema Septim. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the events of <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, the former High King of Skyrim was the late ruler 
        of Solitude, Torygg. When the Jarl of Windhelm and leader of the Stormcloak Rebellion, 
        Ulfric Stormcloak, killed High King Torygg, it exploded into the Skyrim Civil War.
        Solitude was the headquarters of the pro-Empire faction, with General Tullius commanding the 
        Imperial Legion from Castle Dour, while the newly appointed Jarl Elisif would continue
        governing the hold of Haafingar from the Blue Palace.
