    <p style="text-align: justify;">Riften is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, and is the hold capital of the Rift. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is built on the shores of Lake Honrich, and is surrounded by the expansive Fall Forest.
        Riften lies close to Skyrim's borders with Cyrodiil and Morrowind. Much of the land surrounding Riften is farmland.
         Fort Greenwall serves an 
        important bulwark against incursions from the north.
        <br><br>
        Riften's architecture and layout reflect the local environment and its role as a center of trade. 
        In the Fourth Era, buildings are made of wood from the forest, and the heart of the city is its 
        market square and dockyards, which together are known as the Plankside district. Plankside is 
        separated from the rest of the city, Dryside, by a large canal with water-level entrances to 
        lower quarters and a complex sewer system. These sewers, affectionately called The Ratway, 
        are used as a refuge for the impoverished and outlaws, and also hold the headquarters of the 
        Thieves Guild in Skyrim, who can trace their origins in Riften back to the Second Era. On the 
        city's east side, there is a Temple of Mara (Goddess of Love).
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Riften is also the home of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim, and has 
        become infamous as a town where the aspiring rogue or thief can rise among the criminal underworld.
        The city enjoys robust trade with Morrowind via the nearby pass through the Velothi Mountains.
        Mistveil Keep is the seat of the Jarl of Riften and contains the barracks of the city guard.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the Skyrim Civil War, which took place in <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, the city
        of Riften was aligned with the Stormcloak Rebellion.
