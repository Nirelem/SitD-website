    <p style="text-align: justify;">Winterhold  is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, and it serves as the 
        capital city of Winterhold hold. 
        For the longest time, Winterhold served as the capital of Skyrim, one with a rich and illustrious history that could 
        rival Solitude to the west. The city had many large districts for most of its history. 
        The most well-known landmark in the city (and perhaps the only noteworthy thing nowadays) is the College of Winterhold, 
        Skyrim's premier institute in the arcane arts.
<br><br>
<b>Quick History: </b>In 4E 122, an event known as the Great Collapse occured out of nowhere. A large portion of the cliff
which had served as the city's foundation, suddenly collapsed and most of the city was cast down into the Sea of Ghosts. 
However, the College of Winterhold was mysteriously unscathed, despite it being at the center of where most of the collapse occured.
The College still stands to this day, along with a few other houses and a humble Jarl's longhouse.
<br><br>
During the events of <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, Winterhold was aligned with the Stormcloak Rebellion.
