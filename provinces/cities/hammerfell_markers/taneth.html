    <p style="text-align: justify;">Taneth is one of the eight major cities in the 
        province of Hammerfell. Taneth is a bustling and 
        important port city.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is situated on the coastal highlands 
        of southern Hammerfell. The ancient tomb of the 
        al-Danobia bloodline is located northwest of the 
        city and it is considered part of the Kingdom of Taneth. 
        Taneth is established on the eastern side of Hew's Bay
        and is equipped with a harbor.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Taneth is strongly a Forebear city, but the 
        al-Danobia bloodline had always held significant 
        power over the Kingdom for many untold years.
        Beyond the Danobia bloodline, Taneth is the home 
        of several noble families, such as House Suda 
        and the Moguls. The latter is held in high 
        prestige and is famous for its calvary.
        Taneth is located on a major western trading 
        route utilized by the East Empire Company. 
        Through this route, it is connected to the 
        cities Rihad and Hegathe.
        Trade going to Taneth, either through 
        the mainland or through the sea has always 
        been affected by the merchant lords of Abah's Landing, 
        in Hew's Bane. They tend to hire pirates or bandits 
        to interfere in the traffic in Taneth.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html"> Great War</a>, 
        the Aldmeri Dominion 
        conquered the southern coast of Hammerfell, 
        excluding the city of Hegathe. When the Empire 
        signed the White-Gold Concordat, they ended the 
        war between them and the Dominion, but had to 
        abandon Hammerfell in the process. Five years later, 
        the Redguards reclaimed the land from the Dominion, 
        and ended the war between them by signing the Second 
        Treaty of Stros M'Kai.
