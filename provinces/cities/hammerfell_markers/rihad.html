        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rihad is one of the eight major cities in the province of Hammerfell, 
        situated in the southernmost point of the province.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is near the mouth of the Brena River, which is the border
        between Hammerfell and Cyrodiil. Rihad's region has a tropical 
        wet-dry climate and is prone to the occasional forest fire.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Rihad is a port city occupied by the Forebears, and is
        much more cosmopolitan than the traditional Crowns cities to the north.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Not much is known about Rihad during the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html">Great War</a>, but what is 
        apparent is that the cities across southern Hammerfell had fallen 
        to the Aldmeri Dominion, with only Hegathe to the west left standing.
        When the White-Gold Concordat was signed, Hammerfell had officially 
        ceded from the Empire. This was a problem for the noble house of Rihad
        as they were formerly Imperial loyalists. Prince Dinahan al-Rihad 
        was exiled from the throne and later granted asylum in Cyrodiil 
        by the Empire. During his time there, he became an arena combatant 
        and had active intent to retake the throne.
