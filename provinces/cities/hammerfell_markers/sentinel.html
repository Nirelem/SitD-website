    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sentinel is a great city of the Redguards, and the capital of both 
        the kingdom of Sentinel and the province of Hammerfell.
        It is located in the northwestern hills of Hammerfell, overlooking the Iliac Bay.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Its population is relatively low due to the inhospitable 
        nature of the surrounding Alik'r Desert. However, some 
        fertile fields can be found along the coast near the city, 
        and the city is actually a major population center in 
        Hammerfell. Sentinel contains a structure called the Impervious
        Vault â€” a fortified storehouse under the city that 
        houses the Ansei Wards, ancient Redguard relics 
        that ward off necromancy.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>The city is an exotic retreat for the nobility of 
        Daggerfall and Wayrest, who delight in the cooking, 
        craftsmanship, and plays which can be found there.
        It has historically been a Forebear city.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>In 4E 42, <a href="../../../lore/altmer.html"> Altmer</a> dissidents who had fled to 
        Sentinel from the Thalmor (the high elf n*zis) in Alinor were attacked 
        by Thalmor operatives in what became known as the 
        Night of Green Fire. The entire refugee district
        of the city was destroyed. An Altmer legionary named 
        Legate Fasendil was stationed there at the time
        and commented, "The Aldmeri Dominion was not content
        with killing dissidents at home, so they went to 
        Hammerfell to finish the job."
