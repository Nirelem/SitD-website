    <p style="text-align: justify;">Skaven (also known as Ska'vyn) is one of the eight 
        major cities in the province of Hammerfell, situated 
        in the region of Sunforge in central Hammerfell.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is located near the Dragontail Mountains.
        The region the city is located
        in is prone to frequent sandstorms and scorching heat.
        The city reveres Tu'whacca (Redguard God of Souls) and 
        contains a great necropolis. On the northern 
        outskirts of Skaven lies the Caverns 
        of Wry, which contains herds of Skav Bats that are bred 
        to produce dairy by the locals.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>The city is situated in hostile desert lands but is
        kept alive by its use as a trading hub connecting
        the cities of Dragonstar and Elinhir to the east.
        The city even contains a headquarters for visiting
        caravans. Despite the desolate surroundings the city
        is located in, the city has a culture of festivities, 
        known for its carnivals and Firedancers.
        Skaven is a Crown city, and their old traditions
        are especially prevalent in this city.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html"> Great War</a>, the Imperial Legion, under 
        General Decianus had a bloody skirmish with the 
        Aldmeri Dominion outside of Skaven's wall, 
        but the city was captured by the Aldmeri Dominion. 
        However, Lady Arannelya's forces were unable to 
        move out and continue their campaign. The general was then ordered 
        return to Cyrodiil and assist in its defense. Before the 
        general returned to the Imperial City in 4E 174, 
        he discharged many soldiers that later formed the 
        core of fighters that retook Skaven from the Dominion 
        and drove Arannelya's force back across the Alik'r Desert.
