                <li><p>The city is found in the fertile grasslands 
                    on the tropical western shore landings of the 
                    Abecean Sea.</p></li>
                <li><p>The entire peninsula that the city 
                    itself is found upon is a lush subtropical 
                    rainforest biome.</p></li>
                <li><p>The city is known for its austere ramparts 
                    that harken back to antiquity, and is considered 
                    an equal to <a href="../highrock_markers/wayrest.html">
                    Wayrest</a> in terms of splendor.</p></li>
                <li><p>Like other traditional cities in Hammerfell, 
                    it is built atop of old ruins of past civilizations, 
                    replaced with high domes and flying dew sails that 
                    are well-suited for the harsh environment.</p></li>
                <li><p>It is a city of contrasts with tall, plain stone 
                    ramparts found side-by-side with beautiful 
                    gold-engraved tents, and a busy modern harbor 
                    found near the calm ancient shrines.</p></li>

                <li><p>Hegathe was once 
                    the capital of Hammerfell, ever since the 
                    Yokudans landed on its shores back in the 
                    First Era.   </p></li>
                <li><p>Thanks to its coastal plains environment, 
                    the city has vineyards where they make their 
                    signature wine.</p></li>
                <li><p>One of the city's most iconic landmarks is 
                    the Shrine of <a href="../../../lore/religion/tava.html">Tava</a> 
                    (Redguard deity, Goddess of the 
                    weather), a place of veneration for both the

                    Crowns and Forebears</a>.</p></li>
