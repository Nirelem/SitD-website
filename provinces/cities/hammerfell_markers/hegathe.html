    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hegathe is one of the eight major cities 
        in the province of Hammerfell. It was once 
        the capital of Hammerfell, ever since the 
        Yokudans landed on its shores back in the 
        First Era.   
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is found in the fertile grasslands 
        on the tropical western shore landings of the 
        Abecean Sea. The entire peninsula that the city 
        itself is found upon is a lush subtropical 
        rainforest biome. It is known for its austere ramparts 
        that harken back to antiquity, and is considered 
        an equal to Wayrest in terms of splendor.
        Like other traditional cities in Hammerfell, 
        it is built atop of old ruins of past civilizations, 
        replaced with high domes and flying dew sails that 
        are well-suited for the harsh environment.
        It is a city of contrasts with tall, plain stone 
        ramparts found side-by-side with beautiful 
        gold-engraved tents, and a busy modern harbor 
        found near the calm ancient shrines.
        Thanks to its coastal plains environment, 
        the city has vineyards where they make their 
        signature wine.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>One of the city's most iconic landmarks is 
        the Shrine of Tava(a Redguard deity, Goddess of the 
        weather), a place of veneration for both the 
        Crowns and the Forebears. The site symbolizes 
        an ideal: the union of the two factions. Being on the southern part of Hammerfell,
        it is probably under the influence of the Forebears.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html">Great War</a>, 
        Hegathe was being defended
by a Crown army. When it was besieged by Aldmeri Dominion
forces, a relief army of Forebears arrived and lifted the siege.
This victory brought the reconciliation of the two parties
and was start of the tenuous peace that they have today.
