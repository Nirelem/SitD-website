    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lilmoth is one of the eight major cities in the province 
        of Black Marsh, serving as the most centralized 
        settlement in the region of Murkmire. Lilmoth is colloquially 
        known as the "Festering Jewel of Black Marsh". 
        The city is known for the sunken <a href="../../../lore/imperials.html"> Imperial</a> villas that 
        were built during the Second Empire's hold over the region.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Lilmoth is built on wetlands that make up the southern
        region of Murkmire, and is surrounded by rainforests.
        Being built over shallow waters, large 
        ships are unable to dock at the city and are instead 
        required to anchor in the Southern Sea, remaining 
        close enough to move goods.
        <br><br>
        Lilmoth is a walled-off settlement, surrounded by 
        traditional Imperial walls for the most part. Despite the 
        outward appearance of an Imperial settlement, 
        most of Lilmoth's architecture is Argonian, 
        using a style of building made for the marshes of 
        Murkmire. These structures are supported by wooden stilts, 
        which sometimes extend high into the air over the city. 
        In comparison, Imperial homes built on that soil quickly 
        sank into the swamp. Nearer the walls are a few intact Imperial buildings.
        Old Imperial Lilmoth is a district filled with ancient Imperial 
        ruins, old encrusted villas festooned with vines, large bamboos, and sleeping palms.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>After the events of <i>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>, an Argonian nationalist,
        anti-foreigner political party called the <a href="../../../lore/argonians.html#anxileel"> An-Xileel</a> rose to power.
        The An-Xileel in Lilmoth wrestled control of the city from the Third Empire.
        Foreigner inhabitants were permitted to stay but were treated with scrutiny
        by An-Xileel Argonians. Imperial institutions were removed from Lilmoth, and
        the Old Imperial Lilmoth district was looted.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Early in the 4th Era, Lilmoth was ravaged by the undead forces
        of Umbriel, a floating island-city that required the souls of the
        dead to stay afloat. The An-Xileel were able to take back the city but
        all of the foreigners and non-An-Xileel Argonians were killed.
