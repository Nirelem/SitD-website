    <p style="text-align: justify;">Gideon is one of the eight major cities in the province 
        of Black Marsh, situated in the flooded hillscape of 
        Blackwood. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city is surrounded by steep and lightly forested 
        hills to the west and the humid marshland to the 
        northeast.
        <br><br>
        The city is built majorly in the <a href="../../../lore/imperials.html"> Imperial </a>architectural style.
        Most of the city's buildings are located on the main road because 
        it's the only dry ground left through Gideon, so important 
        structures such as the Temple of Dibella (the Goddess of Beauty)
        and the Governor's Mansion can be found here. While the main 
        road is large and spacious, the streets of Gideon are 
        described as cramped and labyrinthine. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>Gideon is a sleepy frontier town that serves 
        as a gateway to the greater and treacherous expanse of 
        the province. It is a mixture of two cultures, 
        from the modern-day Imperials to the 
        Argonians of Blackwood. Gideon is 
        often visited and settled by those that 
        seek out Black Marsh's wonders.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Early in the 4th Era, Gideon was overrun by the undead forces of 
        Umbriel, a floating island-city that required the souls of the
        dead to stay afloat. Fortunately, Gideon has mostly recovered 
        as of the current day.
