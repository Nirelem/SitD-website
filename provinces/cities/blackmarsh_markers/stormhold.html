    <p style="text-align: justify;">Stormhold is one of the eight major cities in the 
        province of Black Marsh, serving as the largest 
        settlement of the region of Shadowfen. Stormhold 
        has a dark history that involves the nearby <a href="../../../lore/dunmer.html"> Dark 
        Elves</a>, as it was once the foothold of their slavery 
        industry in the province. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Stormhold is located near the banks of a mighty river 
        that forms the provincial border between the primordial 
        morass of Black Marsh and the scenic grazelands of Morrowind. 
        But even though the river is practically outside of the 
        city walls, the land around Stormhold is sunken marshes 
        and crocodile-infested ravines with shallow waters.
        
        The town uses both the stone, ornate architecture of 
        the Dark Elves and the large mud huts of the Argonians.
        When the Dark Elves were in control of Stormhold, they 
        fully refurbished the site with proper stone roads, 
        light posts, and long wooden bridges. The local Hist 
        Tree of Stormhold is located in the town square, in 
        the middle of a pond, surrounded by ancient pillars, 
        broken arches, and a small stone wall that circles around it.
        Much of the city is built on top of old ruins and 
        wide-open mounds surrounded by ravines.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>Early in the 4th Era, Stormhold was overrun by the undead forces of 
        Umbriel, a floating island-city that required the souls of the
        dead to stay afloat. Fortunately, Stormhold has mostly recovered 
        as of the current day.
