    <p style="text-align: justify;">Anvil is a prosperous Colovian harbor city on the Gold 
        Coast by the Abecean Sea at the very southwest end of 
        Cyrodiil. It is the seat of County Anvil and it is 
        located at the end of the Gold Road.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The <a href="../../../lore/redguards.html">Redguards</a> have had a notable influence on local 
        architecture, which is of a similar style to that of nearby 
        Hammerfell. Anvil consists of five districts: 
        Castle Anvil, Chapelgate, Westgate, Guildgate and Harborside.
        A large statue of a mermaid can be found in Guildgate district. 
        With no inscription decorating its base and no certificate of 
        origin stored in the city records, the statue remains a blank 
        canvas upon which locals and visitors alike have painted 
        their own picture.
        
        
        <br><br>
        In the hills outside of Anvil are streams with white poplar 
        trees growing around them. Locals consider County Anvil to 
        be premium hunting ground.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html">Great War</a> in 4E 171, the city was put under siege by 
        the armies of the Aldmeri Dominion, which ended with a 
        Dominion victory in 4E 172. When the Great War ended
        with the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the Dominion
        relinquished all conquered territory. Circa 4E 180, Anvil Keep was 
        a ruined structure inhabited by monsters.
