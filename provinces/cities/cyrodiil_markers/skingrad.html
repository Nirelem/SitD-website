    <p style="text-align: justify;">Skingrad is a Colovian town located in the West Weald region 
        of Colovia, to the southwest of the Imperial City.
        Skingrad is known as the Gem of Old Colovia, and a 
        model of the Colovian virtues of independence, hard 
        work, and tough-mindedness.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>The city divides into three districts: the Castle, 
        Hightown, and Chapel, with various gates and bridges 
        connecting each district. The city is further 
        divided in two parts: the north wall encompasses 
        the Hightown district and the guild halls, while 
        the southern half holds homes and the Great Chapel 
        of Julianos (God of Magic), where citizens and travelers can pray 
        for healing. Castle Skingrad sits on a very steep hill, overlooking 
        the city. The Castle is only accessible by a long series of fortifications
        and bridges that connect it to the Hightown district, due to the sheer 
        steepness of the hill making it virtually unscalable from any other 
        side. This makes Castle Skingrad and the city as a whole very defensible
        against outside forces.
        <br><br>
        <b>Politics: </b>The town is particularly famous for its wines, 
        tomatoes, and cheeses, which contributes to its 
        overall prosperity.  The famous Surilie Brothers 
        wine is made from the vineyards 
        located outside Skingrad.
        <br><br>
        <b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../../../lore/greatwar.html">Great War</a> in 4E 171,
        Skingrad was one of the cities to fall 
        to the Aldmeri Dominion's invasion. When the Great War ended
        with the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the Dominion
        relinquished all conquered territory.
