        Stros M'Kai  is a strategically located tropical 
island off the southern coast of Hammerfell near the 
Cape of the Blue Divide. Palm trees, large leafed 
plants and cacti are a common sight on Stros M'Kai.
Jarrin root, an extremely toxic plant which kills 
almost instantly when ingested, is native to the island.
<br><br>
It is renowned for the 
completely steam-powered <a href="../lore/dwemer.html"> Dwemer</a> ruins of Bthzark and 
the observatory of similar design containing a telescope 
and orrery. Roughly a third of the island is taken up 
by the Ogres Tooth Mountains in the west, containing 
the ruins of Bthzark. Its mines and other facilities 
delve into the southern half of the range, while the 
steam and gas harvesting system that powers the mechanisms 
inside lie above ground in the northern mountains.
<br><br>
Its main two settlements are the city of Port Hunding, 
which has also been called Stros M'Kai at times, and the 
small settlement of Saintsport that is found at the 
southern tip of the island.
<br><br>
<b>Quick History: </b>During the <a href="../lore/greatwar.html">Great War</a>, the Second Treaty
of Stros M'Kai was a treaty signed in 4E 180 between 
the Aldmeri Dominion and the Redguards of Hammerfell. 
It marked the end of a decade-long attempt by the 
Dominion to conquer the region after both sides had 
reached a stalemate. The conditions of the treaty 
compelled the Dominion to withdraw all of its 
military forces from Hammerfell.
Following the Second Treaty of Stros M'Kai, 
Hammerfell was left an independent yet 
severely diminished nation.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Port Hunding, also called Stros M'Kai, is a city 
        on the island of Stros M'Kai. Situated north of 
        Hunding Bay, the city takes up a large portion of 
        the island's area.
        <br><br>
        <b>Architecture & Layout: </b>Port Hunding is divided into roughly four districts: 
        the harbor, market, town square, and old quarter. 
        Ships entering the harbor are greeted by a large 
        metal statue of Frandar Hunding, considered the 
        most accomplished Sword-singer and one of the first
        Yokudans to settle in Hammerfell, with his sword 
        extending out to sea. The old quarter lies northeast 
        of the town square. A large palace is built north 
        of the square on a section of land separated by a river.
