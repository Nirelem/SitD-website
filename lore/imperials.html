        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            Cyrodiil was once ruled by a race of elves known as the <a href="ayleids.html">Ayleids</a>. These elves
            enslaved the native humans, called <b>Nedes</b>, and they were cruel slavemasters. These Nedes would end
            up revolting and overthrowing their elven tyrants. This rebellion was led by Alessia, who is now known 
            as <b>Saint Alessia the Slave Queen</b>, along with the help from the <a href="nords.html">Nords</a> of <a href="../provinces/skyrim.html">Skyrim</a>.
            <br><br>
            The defining feature of Imperial culture is its cosmopolitanism.
            It takes elements from Colovia, Nibenay, <a href="../provinces/highrock.html">High Rock</a>, and even a few 
            elements from the far away continent of <b>Akavir</b>, and incorporates 
            them into a "common whole".
            Although some individual Imperials may be the most arrogant bigots in 
            Tamriel, culturally the Imperials are very conciliatory and congenial, 
            making them skilled diplomats and traders.
            <br><br>
            The Imperials, and Cyrodiil as a whole, are divided into two major culture groups: the <b>Colovians</b> in western Colovia 
            and the <b>Nibenese</b> in eastern Nibenay.
            <br><br>
            The Colovians are known for being practical, militaristic, and independent-minded.
            They prioritize loyalty, discipline, and physical strength, producing many of the Empire's soldiers and generals.
            Their culture is more austere, with less emphasis on religion and mysticism compared to the Nibenese.
            <br><br>
            The Nibenese culture is heavily influenced by ancient Ayleid practices, mysticism, and a pantheon of gods, blending Imperial and Elven elements.
            They emphasize trade, art, and scholarship, often relying on diplomacy and wealth rather than brute strength. They tend to produce 
            the Empire's battlemages, governors, and merchants.

        <h2 id="empires">Empires</h2>
        <p>
            Imperial hegemony has waxed and waned throughout the eras, and most historians refer to three 
            distinct <b>Empires</b>, the ends of which each mark a new epoch in Tamrielic history.           
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>First Empire: </b>Also called the <b>Alessian Empire</b>, the First Empire
                        was established by the former human slaves of the 
                        <a href="ayleids.html">Ayleid</a> Empire in 1E 243 following <b>Alessia's Slave Rebellion</b>.
                        One of the defining events of the Empire was the rise of 
                        the zealously monotheistic <b>Alessian Order</b>. They were a sect
                        of human supremacists and were very against all races of elves.
                        The First Empire ended in 1E 2331.

                    <p>
                        <b>Second Empire: </b>The Second Empire was established in 1E 2703 by <b>Reman Cyrodiil I</b>.
                        At its height, it controlled every region of Tamriel with the exception
                        of <a href="../provinces/morrowind.html">Morrowind</a>.
                        The history of the Second Empire is divided into two main periods: 
                        the reign of the <b>Reman Dynasty</b>, and the subsequent <b>Akaviri Potentate</b>.
                        The Reman Dynasty was founded after he defeated an Akaviri invasion of 
                        Tamriel in 1E 2703. The surviving Akaviri would swear fealty to Reman,
                        and ended up forming the elite bodyguard unit of the Emperor, the <b>Blades</b>.
                        The Reman Dynasty's end at 1E 2920 would mark the last year of the 
                        <b>First Era</b> and the start of the <b>Second Era</b>, but the Second Empire would
                        still endure after this.
                        The Akaviri Potentate would continue to rule the Second Empire at
                        the start of the Second Era until 2E 430, which was the end of the 
                        Second Empire.

                    <p>
                        <b>Third Empire: </b>The Third Empire was declared by <b>Tiber Septim</b> in 2E 854, the last year of the <b>Second Era</b>,
                        after a decades-long conflict to unite Tamriel knowns as the Tiber War.
                        It achieved what the Second Empire could not, and united every 
                        region in Tamriel under one banner.
                        After Tiber Septim's death, he became revered as a god, and was added 
                        to the pantheon of the Eight Divines, which soon became the <b>Nine Divines</b>.
                        His deified image was renamed to <b>Talos</b>, the God-Hero of Mankind.
                        The Septim Dynasty ended in 3E 433 when <b>Martin Septim</b> sacrificed himself
                        at the end of <i>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>. The end of the Septim 
                        bloodline marked the end of the <b>Third Era</b>, but the Empire still endured
                        into the <b>Fourth Era</b>.

        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            Imperials primarily worship the <b>Divines</b>, which consist of the original <b>Eight Divines</b> plus the ascended Talos.
            Together, they make the <b>Nine Divines</b>. However, in recent years, Talos worship was banned due to the peace deal that ended
            the <a href="greatwar.html">Great War</a>. 
            <h3>Nine Divines</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><p><b>Akatosh:</b>
                    Akatosh, known as Auri-El to the elves, is the Dragon God of Time and chief deity of the Divines. He represents endurance, 
                    stability, and the passage of time and is revered as the father of dragons and a symbol of the Empire’s legitimacy.

        <p>
            The <a href="greatwar.html">Great War</a> was fought from 4E 171 to 175. It's conclusion was a terrible blow for the 
            Empire, and it's effects are still felt in the present day. The most notable of these are: 
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li><p>The banning of <b>Talos</b> worship.</p></li>
                <li><p>The disbandment of the <b>Blades</b>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Legal immunity for Thalmor Justiciars to patrol Imperial territory and enforce the terms of the treaty.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The Great War is perhaps one of the most important recent historical events that are relevant to our campaign.
