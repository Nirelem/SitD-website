        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            Argonian society is deeply rooted in the swamps of Black Marsh, characterized 
            by its tribal organization and unique connection to the <b>Hist</b>. Tribes are the 
            central social structure, with leaders and shamans often acting as intermediaries 
            between the Argonians and the Hist. Their culture values adapting to change and a 
            deep spiritual connection to nature. 
            The warm and fetid swamps of Black Marsh are toxic to most 
            outsiders, except for the Argonians who have evolved to be 
            adapted to it. Argonians hatch from eggs, and it is the 
            Hist that forms their biology, molding them into creatures 
            that can withstand the environment of Black Marsh. 
            <br><br>
            Argonians tend to speak with a certain detachment that 
            might seem particularly strange to individuals with a formal 
            upbringing centered around manners. Argonians do not facially 
            express their emotions as much as men and mer do, though anger 
            is fairly easy to detect through bared teeth and narrowed eyes.
            <br><br>
            There are two types of Argonians: those native to Black Marsh, and those either born and/or raised outside of Black Marsh.
            The latter is refered to as <b>lukiul</b>, which means <i>assimilated to another culture</i>.
            Lukiul Argonians have an unclear connection to the Hist, due to the absence of Hist sap,
            which is an essential part to communing with the Hist. Argonians who leave Black Marsh
            and spend a prolonged period of time away from the Hist may feel their connection to the 
            Hist weaken, and may even be unable to hear the Hist at all. Lukiul have difficulty understanding the body language of 
            marsh-born Argonians, and they are often treated as outsiders by the natives of Black Marsh.
            <br><br>
            For millenia, the <a href="dunmer.html">Dunmer</a> have raided the lands of Black Marsh
            for slave labor. Entire tribes were dragged off in chains to Morrowind.
            The Dunmeri Great House Dres had been cemented as a Great House for their
            efficiency in conducting slave-raids, and becoming the primary providers for 
            the slave trade in their homeland.
            While some Dark Elves saw the enslavement of the Argonians as a 
            great uplifting and betterment for the race in general, the Lizard 
            Folk themselves detested their so-called masters and resisted them 
            constantly.
            <br><br>
            However, in the late Third Era, the government of Morrowind would eventually 
            abolish the enslavement of other races and deemed it as illegal.
            With the abolition of slavery, the Argonians' relationship with 
            the Dunmer vastly improved, although violent attempts to reclaim 
            the lands stolen from them would still continue.

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>The Hist</h3>
            
            The Hist is the central focus of Argonian spirituality and religion. The Hist are sentient, 
            ancient trees that are believed to be the progenitors of the Argonians, providing guidance
            to their people.
            The Hist's roots run deep beneath the soil of Black Marsh, connecting 
            them all, and thus connecting all Argonians. As the Hist are all 
            connected at the roots, they have a collective consciousness, and 
            can communicate with each other. 
            Argonians see themselves as extensions of 
            the Hist’s will, often communing with the trees through rituals and consuming Hist sap during 
            key life events, such as adulthood or bonding ceremonies. The Hist are also said to influence 
            Argonian physiology, determining their traits and abilities based on the needs of the Hist and 
            the environment. Argonian religion is not dogmatic or hierarchical but deeply personal and tied 
            to their everyday lives, making it distinct from the organized religions of other Tamrielic races.
           <br><br>
           During the <a href="oblivioncrisis.html">Oblivion Crisis</a> in 3E 433, the Hist 
            trees foresaw this coming disaster and called many Argonians 
            back to defend their homeland. The Argonians were altered 
            by the Hist in order to combat the Daedra (demons), becoming 
            faster, stronger, and able to endure harsher punishment. 
            When the Daedra launched their invasion of Black Marsh, 
            the Lizard Folk fought them back so viciously that the 
            Daedra themselves were forced to close their portals to 
            Black Marsh, to avoid being overrun. Because of this, the 
            Argonians emerged from the Oblivion Crisis more united and 
            stronger than ever before compared to the other Tamrielic 
            races, who were devastated by the crisis.
        </p>
        <h2 id="anxileel">The An-Xileel and the Accession War</h2>
        <p>
            The An-Xileel is a political and military faction that rose 
            to prominence during and after the <a href="oblivioncrisis.html">Oblivion Crisis</a>, becoming 
            the de facto ruling body of Black Marsh. They are fiercely 
            nationalistic and dedicated to protecting Argonian 
            sovereignty, often viewing foreign powers like the Empire 
            and the <a href="dunmer.html">Dunmer</a> as threats. The An-Xileel are closely tied 
            to the Hist, with their policies and actions heavily 
            influenced by the trees’ guidance. Their leadership during 
            the Oblivion Crisis was critical, as they coordinated the 
            Argonians’ aggressive defense of Black Marsh. 
            Under the An-Xileel, Black Marsh has become increasingly 
            isolationist, emphasizing independence and the preservation 
            of Argonian culture over integration with the rest of Tamriel.
            <br><br>
            In 4E 5, Red Mountain in Morrowind erupted and threw the province into 
            disarray. The An-Xileel took advantage of this opportunity and, in 
            the following year of 4E 6, they launched an invasion into Morrowind which would be called the <b>Accession War</b>.
            Their invasion devastated much of southern and eastern Morrowind, and 
            they even sacked the former capital city of Mournhold. The war would 
            end when the Argonians were driven out by the armies of House Redoran.
