        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <b>Nords</b>, also called <b>the Children of the Sky</b> are a race of tall, burly and fair-haired humans from Skyrim</p>
        <h2>Summary: </h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 250px;">
            <li><p>Known for being fierce, strong and enthusiastic warriors.</p></li>
            <li><p>Average human liifespan (70-80 years).</p></li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            The Nords' origins are tied to the ancient human 
            migrations from <b>Atmora</b>, a northern, frozen land now 
            mostly lost to time. These early human settlers, known 
            as the Atmorans, arrived in Tamriel around the 
            Merethic Era and the First Era, and eventually 
            spread into what would become Skyrim, developing a 
            hardy, warrior-based society. The Nords were shaped 
            by the harsh climate of Skyrim, their culture 
            emphasizing strength and honor. 

            <br><br>
            The first human settlement in Skyrim was a city 
            called Saarthal.
            But this city was sacked and razed by the native 
            <a href="falmer.html">Snow Elves</a>. 
            In response to this terrible atrocity, <b>Ysgramor 
                </b>and his <b>Five Hundred 
                Companions</b> would sail from Atmora and conquer 
            all of Skyrim from 
            the Snow Elves.
            <br><br>
            The Nords have a strong warrior culture, with 
            combat skills being highly valued and training 
            starting at a young age. However, they also view 
            magic with distrust and treat any magic-user with 
            suspicion. They live in a 
            clan-based structure, where family ties and 
            loyalty to one’s kin and community are paramount. 
            Cowardice is the worst trait a Nord can exhibit, for 
            "a Nord is judged not by the manner in which he lived, but the manner in which he died".
            <br><br>
            The Nords are ruled by one <b>High King</b>, but the 
            province is divided into nine holds that are each led
            by a <b>Jarl</b>.
            Jarls are the local rulers of holds and their
            respective capital cities, and are the 
            leaders of the territories the hold encompasses. 
            They govern with a council of <b>Thanes</b> 
            (noble warriors) who offer advice and support
            to the Jarl's court.
        </p>
        <h2 >Religion</h2>
        <p>
            The Nords are considered to be a devout people with grim religious beliefs.
            As dark as their belief systems are viewed to be, all Nordic traditions extend one bright, 
            shining hope for Nords: <b>Sovngarde</b>, the Hall of Valor, where Nords who have proven their mettle in 
            battle or died valiantly are welcome to experience euphoric bliss and camaraderie, free from time and boredom.
            <br><br>
            There are two main pantheons which the Nords follow, both of which consisting of 
            the <b>Aedra</b> (gods): The Imperial Pantheon of the Divines, and the Nordic Pantheon.
            Most Nords who support the Empire and/or have assimilated into Imperial culture tend
            to follow the Imperial Pantheon, especially the worship of <b>Talos</b>, the Ninth Divine and 
            God-Hero of Mankind. Those who still follow the Old Ways will likely 
            worship the older Nordic Pantheon.
            <h3>Nine Divines</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><p><b>Akatosh:</b>

                    stability, and the passage of time and is revered as the father of dragons and a symbol of the Empire’s legitimacy.

    <h2 id="skyrimcivilwar">The White-Gold Concordat and the Skyrim Civil War</h2>
    <p>
        At the end of the <a href="greatwar.html">Great War</a>, the Empire signed the 
        <b>While-Gold Concordat</b> in order to end the war between the Empire and the 
        <a href="altmer.html#thalmor">Aldmeri Dominion</a>. A major concession included 
        in the treaty was the banning of <b>Talos</b> worship. Talos is widely revered 
        among the Nords of Skyrim, and this caused a large portion of Nords to resent 
        the Empire. 
        <br><br>
        This would eventually lead to the <b>Skyrim Civil War</b>, which took place in 
        <i>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, that pitted the western, pro-Empire half of Skyrim 
        against the <b>Stormcloak Rebellion</b> of the eastern half.
