        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <b>Redguards</b>, are a human race that primarily inhabits the province of Hammerfell.</p>
        <h2>Summary: </h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 250px;">

        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            The Redguards are descended from the <b>Yokudans</b>, a 
            seafaring people from the continent of <b>Yokuda</b>, west 
            of Tamriel. When a catastrophic event, often believed 
            to be the sinking of Yokuda, destroyed their homeland, 
            the Yokudans migrated to Tamriel in the First Era. 
            They were fierce warriors and master sailors, 
            bringing their advanced martial traditions with them. After arriving 
            in Hammerfell, they clashed with the native elves, goblins,  
            and human tribes, quickly establishing dominance over the region.
            
        </p>
        <h2>Crowns and Forebears</h2>
        <p>
            The arrival of the Yokudans to Hammerfell did not happen all 
            at once; they migrated in waves. The first wave of migrants 
            to arrive on Hammerfell were the <b>Forebears</b>. The Forebears settled
            the first Redguard cities on Hammerfell, focused on the coastal 
            areas. The latter waves of migrants were known as the <b>Crowns</b>, 
            and they were the old nobility and ruling class of Yokuda. They
            were the last to leave Yokuda before it sank. The Crowns settled further
            inland and, being the old rulers of Yokudan society, tend to preserve
            and cling onto their ancient Yokudan traditions.
            <br><br>
            For most of their history, the Crown Redguards and the 
            Forebear Redguards were bitter rivals and had many bloody
            conflicts between them. The Crowns dislike the Forebears 
            because they are more progressive and open to the cultures
            of other races, forgetting their ancient traditions in favor 
            of tolerating and assimilating to the Empire. 
            The Forebears dislike the Crowns because they
            view them as just stuck-up conservatives who are
            stuck in the past.
        </p>
        <h2 >Religion</h2>
        <p>
            Redguards have come to venerate different gods, 
            with the Crowns sticking to the most ancient Yokudan 
            pantheon, while Forebear beliefs have evolved to include 
            many <a href="imperials.html">Imperial</a> influences. Many of the Crowns are nomadic 
            tribesman who mainly travel around the <b>Alik'r</b>, and though 
            they adhere to traditional Yokudan beliefs, they have also 
            developed a deep, spiritual attachment to their adopted land.

    <h2>The Great War and Ceding from the Empire</h2>
    <p>
        During the <a href="greatwar.html">Great War</a>, Hammerfell became a major battleground between the 
        <a href="altmer.html#thalmor">Aldmeri Dominion</a> and the Empire. 
        The Dominion launched a massive invasion of Hammerfell in 4E 171, overwhelming much of the southern regions,
        and conquered every city on the souther coast, with the exception of <a href="../provinces/cities/hammerfell_markers/hegathe.html">Hegathe</a>.
        <br><br>
        When the <b>White-Gold Concordat</b> was signed in 4E 175, 
        ending the war between the Empire and the Dominion, one 
        of its terms ceded parts of southern Hammerfell to the Dominion. 
        The Redguards, refusing to accept this concession, rejected the 
        treaty and declared independence from the Empire. This led to the 
        Second War with the Dominion, where the Redguards, united under 
        the Crowns and Forebears, fought a bloody, prolonged conflict 
        to drive the Dominion out of Hammerfell. By 4E 180, the Redguards 
        successfully expelled the Dominion, preserving their homeland and 
        earning a reputation as one of the few provinces to stand against 
        the Thalmor and emerge victorious.
