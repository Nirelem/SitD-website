            typically red-eyed elven peoples of Morrowind.</p>
        <h2>Summary: </h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 250px;">
            <li><p>Known for being grim, aloof, and/or reserved, but also valuing loyalty and family.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lifespan two to three times as long as humans.</p></li>
            <li><p>They tend to distrust and are distrusted by other races, often called proud, clannish, ruthless, and cruel by outsiders.</p></li>
            <li><p>Their combination of powerful intellects with strong and agile physiques produce superior warriors and sorcerers.</p></li>
            <li><p>In battle, they are skilled with a balanced integration of the sword, the bow and destruction magic.</p></li>
            <li><p>However, the Dunmer's vengeful nature, age-old conflicts, betrayals, and ill-reputation prevent them from gaining more influence.</p></li>
            <li><p>The most notable Dunmer are from the Five Great Houses that govern Morrowind: <b>Redoran</b>, <b>Sadras</b>, <b>Telvanni</b>, <b>Dres</b>, and <b>Indoril</b>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            Like all elves, the ancestors of the Dunmer originated from
            <a href="../provinces/summerset.html">Summerset</a>, and were know as the <b>Chimer</b>.
            The Chimer were a sect of Altmer dissidents who were outcasted 
            for their worship of the <b>Daedra</b> (demons).
            They followed the prophet <b>Veloth</b> in search of spiritual freedom, leaving 
            the Summerset Isles to settle in present-day Morrowind. 
            Guided by their worship of the <b>Good Daedra</b> (<i>see below</i>), 
            they rejected the traditional <b>Aedra</b> worship of 
            their kin and sought to establish their own culture and 
            religious practices. Upon reaching Morrowind, 
            they clashed with the native <a href="dwemer.html">Dwemer</a>, resulting in a 
            long-standing rivalry. The Chimer lived as a proud and 
            independent people, until a certain group of their leaders
            committed an act of heresy against the Daedra. 
            This act provoked the <b>Daedric Prince of Dusk and Dawn</b>, 
            <b>Azura</b>, who cursed them, transforming the Chimer's 
            once golden skin into the ashen gray skin of the Dunmer today.
        </p>
        <h2>Ashlanders and Great Houses.</h2>
        <p>
            Dark Elven culture is divided between the nomadic <b>Ashlanders</b> and the settled <b>Great Houses</b>.
            <br><br>
            In the Ashlands, native Ashlander tribes ruled without laws or government and lived strictly by codes, rituals, and 
            ancient traditions usually dictated by a wise woman or seer and implemented by a clan leader. They lived 
            in the deserts and plains of the Ashlands and Grazelands.
            <br><br>
            In the more civilized parts of Morrowind, they are ruled by one of the five Great Houses:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>House Redoran: </b>Known for their martial prowess and honor-bound traditions, House Redoran focuses on duty, discipline, and defending Morrowind.
                        They are staunchly traditional and often serve as protectors of their people, valuing warriors and military leadership above all.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>House Sadras: </b>The newest Great House, Sadras replaced the former House Hlaalu when it was stripped of its Great House Status and 
                        removed from the Grand Council of Morrowind. House Sadras' prior status and holdings are unknown, all that is known is that they inherited whatever holdings
                        House Hlaalu formerly possessed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>House Telvanni: </b>A reclusive and eccentric house of powerful mages, House Telvanni values magical knowledge, individualism, and ambition.
                        Members often live in towering mushroom-shaped manors and prioritize personal power and autonomy over alliances or moral concerns.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>House Indoril: </b>The deeply religious and traditional house, House Indoril is closely tied to the Temple and Morrowind's spiritual life.
                        They are highly conservative, often resisting change, and many Indoril members view the Dunmer's ancient customs as sacred.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>House Dres: </b>Centered in the southern regions, House Dres is known for its agrarian economy, particularly the use of slavery to maintain vast plantations.
                        It was cemented as a Great House for their efficiency in conducting slave-raids, and becoming the primary providers for the slave trade in Morrowind.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            The Dunmer have resisted the worship of the <b>Aedra</b> (gods), and instead worship the <b>Good Daedra</b> and the spirits of their ancestors. 
            <h3>Ancestor Worship</h3>
            <p>
                Ancestor worship is a hallmark of Dunmer culture. They believe the spirits of the dead live on in the mortal realm. 
                The spirits know and can affect the future, speak with other spirits, and perform great feats of magic. As such, 
                the Dunmer honor their deceased ancestors, giving them gifts and petitioning them for aid and protection.
                <br><br>
                House Dunmer have family shrines in their homes to venerate their ancestors. In poorer homes, the 
                shrine may consist of a hearth or alcove where family relics are displayed, but wealthy House Dunmer 
                set aside an entire room for their ancestors to use. The shrine is referred to as the "Waiting Door", 
                and represents the door to <b>Oblivion</b>. When a family member dies, their remains are interred in ash pits 
                within ancestral tombs.
                <br><br>
                The Dark Elves' murky reputation among the human races is due in part to the practices and spirit magic associated 
                with ancestor worship; they abhor the notion of summoning one's ancestors from beyond the veil. The Dunmer summon 
                dead ancestors to consult their wisdom and ask them to protect their tombs, but they don't consider this necromancy. 
                Necromancy outside of acceptable clan rituals is taboo.
            </p>
            <h3>The Good Daedra</h3>
            <p>The <b>Three Good Daedra</b> is the Dunmer term for three of the Daedric Princes: <b>Azura</b>, 
                <b>Boethiah</b>, <b>Mephala</b>. These Princes are worshipped by the Dunmer as their ancestors.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Azura:</b> The Daedric Prince of Dawn, Dusk, and Change, Azura is associated with prophecy, twilight, and the transition between beginnings and endings.
                        She is seen as a guide and protector of the Dunmer, despite her cursing them with ashen skin and red eyes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Boethiah:</b> The Daedric Prince of Deceit, Conspiracy, and Ambition, Boethiah represents the pursuit of power and the overthrow of tyrants.
                        Revered as a teacher and warrior, Boethiah is credited with guiding the Chimer to Morrowind and teaching them the ways of rebellion and strength.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Mephala:</b> The Daedric Prince of Secrets, Murder, and Sex, Mephala is the patron of subtle manipulation and the weaving of plots.
                        She is seen as the webspinner, teaching the Chimer about diplomacy, espionage, and assassination to achieve their goals.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Bad Daedra</h3>
            <p>The Bad Daedra are the contrast to the Good Daedra, and are believed to test the Dunmer people's resolve and faith, embodying the things that harm the stability of their society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Molag Bal: </b>Known as the Daedric Prince of Domination, Enslavement, and Vampirism, Molag Bal embodies cruelty and the desire to enslave mortals.
                        He is particularly despised by the Dunmer for his role in corrupting and tormenting mortals, and his influence is associated with destruction and suffering.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Mehrunes Dagon: </b>The Daedric Prince of Destruction, Revolution, and Ambition, Mehrunes Dagon is the harbinger of chaos and natural disasters.
                        Feared for his violent and unrelenting nature, he represents upheaval and change through ruin, often bringing devastation to mortals.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Sheogorath: </b>The Daedric Prince of Madness, Sheogorath revels in chaos, insanity, and unpredictable behavior.
                        While his influence can be chaotic and destructive, it is sometimes seen as a source of creativity and unconventional thinking, though most fear his erratic whims.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Malacath: </b>The Daedric Prince of Outcasts, Malacath is the patron of the oppressed and exiled, particularly the <a href="orcs.html">Orcs</a> .
                        To the Dunmer, he is seen as a god of curses and vengeance, often representing the darker aspects of retribution and ostracism.

            </ul>

        <h2>The Red Year and The Argonian Invasion</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Red Year</b> occurred in <b>4E 5</b>, marking a cataclysmic 
            event in Morrowind's history. The eruption of <a href="../provinces/cities/morrowind_markers/redmountain.html">Red 
                Mountain</a> devastated the surrounding region, destroying 
            <b>Vvardenfell</b> and killing countless Dunmer. 
            The eruption left much of Morrowind in ruins, forcing 
            the surviving Dunmer to flee to the mainland or other 
            provinces.
            <br><br>
            The <b>Argonian Invasion</b> of Morrowind occurred in the 
            aftermath of the Red Year. 
            Taking advantage of Morrowind's devastation following 
            the eruption of Red Mountain, the <a href="argonians.html">Argonians</a>, led by 
            the <a href="argonians.html#anxileel">An-Xileel</a>, launched a massive assault from <a>Black 
            Marsh</a> into southern Morrowind. With their society in 
            disarray and their military weakened, the Dunmer were 
            unable to mount an effective defense, and many of their 
            southern settlements, including the city of Tear, were 
            overrun. The invasion was seen as revenge for centuries 
            of Dunmer enslavement of Argonians. Although the Argonians 
            stopped short of conquering all of Morrowind, the invasion 
            left the region in chaos, forcing the surviving Dunmer to 
            retreat to northern strongholds and marking a significant 
            shift in power between the two races.
