        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <b>Bosmer</b>, or <b>Wood Elves</b>, are the Elven clan-folk of Valenwood.</p>
        <h2>Summary: </h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 250px;">
            <li><p>Small in stature, compared to the other races.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lifespan two to three times as long as humans.</p></li>
            <li><p>Best archers in all Tamriel, they snatch and release arrows in one continuous motion.</p></li>
            <li><p>Very agile, making them excellent scouts and thieves.</p></li>
            <li><p>Affinity for animals, with some Bosmer able to command simple-minded creatures.</p></li>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            Bosmer society is deeply tied to the natural world, with a 
            lifestyle centered around harmony with the forest and a deep 
            respect for the <b>Green Pact</b>, a sacred agreement with the forest 
            god <b>Y’ffre</b>. This pact forbids the Bosmer from harming or 
            consuming plant life in Valenwood, leading them to rely on hunting, 
            trading, and creative use of bone, animal products, and imported 
            goods for sustenance and craftsmanship.
            Despite their communal ties to nature, their society is also 
            fragmented into clans, with no strict central authority, making 
            their alliances and loyalties quite fluid.
        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            The Bosmer venerate many other deities, from <b>Aedra</b> (gods) to <b>Daedra</b> (demons) to other spirits unique to Valenwood.
            Most Bosmer claim direct descent from <b>Auri-El</b>, though <b>Y'ffre</b> is their most important deity.
            like the <a href="argonians.html"> Argonians</a>, the Bosmer seem to prefer to live in the present, showing relatively little 
            regard for the ways of the past (besides when it comes to telling old tales or following the Green Pact, that is).
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><p><b>Y’ffre (Jephre):</b>
                    The central deity and creator of the Bosmer. Known as the Forest God, Y’ffre established 
                    the Green Pact, binding the Bosmer to protect and live in harmony with the forests of Valenwood. 
                    Y’ffre also shaped the world after its chaotic beginnings, making him a figure of order and stability.

                    <p>
                        <b>Auri-El:</b> The Elven King and god of time, equivalent to <b>Akatosh</b> in other cultures' religion. To the Bosmer, Auri-El 
                        represents the connection to their shared Aldmeri heritage and is revered as a distant, guiding force.

                        The Bosmer invoke Arkay in burial rites and see him as the protector of souls after death.

                        He's linked with good-will, cleverness, and is a god of archery which leads to many Bosmer seeking out his guidance.

        <h2>The Silvenar and The Green Lady</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Silvenar</b> and the <b>Green Lady</b> are sacred figures in Bosmer 
            culture, embodying the spiritual and physical aspects of the 
            Bosmer people and their connection to Valenwood.
            <br><br>
            While the <b>Silvenar</b> is often viewed by outsiders as a title for the 
            Bosmer's political representative for foreign affairs, 
            he is more than a mere politician.
            The Silvenar 
            is a spiritual leader and symbolic representative of the Bosmer’s 
            collective voice, often serving as a mediator and diplomat. 
            The Silvenar actually feels the will of the people and acts upon 
            it, and the people likewise can feel the Silvenar's influence and 
            be swayed by it.
            The Silvenar has many rights which grant him great authority 
            in Valenwood. For one, only the Silvenar can grant foreign 
            building and trade contracts, meaning any foreign power which 
            wishes to build in Valenwood or do business with the Bosmer 
            must deal with the Silvenar first.
            <br><br>
            The <b>Green Lady</b>, on the other hand, 
            represents the raw physicality and primal energy of the Bosmer, 
            embodying their strength, passion, and ferocity in defending 
            the forest and their traditions. 
            If the Silvenar dies, his Green Lady's bestial nature is 
            irrevocably unleashed, and her fury turned on all those 
            involved until she joins him in death.
            <br><br>
            Together, the two are bonded 
            through a mystical union that represents Valenwood as a whole. 
            Upon the death of 
            either the Silvenar or the Green Lady, a successor is chosen, 
            ensuring their roles persist and the balance between spirit 
            and nature is maintained.
        </p>
    <h2>The Wild Hunt</h2>
    <p>
        (This is more on the obscure side of lore and will most likely not be relevant to our game ...probably.)
        <br><br>
        The <b>Wild Hunt</b> is a magical trait innate to all Bosmer. It is brought 
        on by a collective ritual performed by many Bosmer, 
        causing them to shapeshift into a horde of feral, 
        eldritch beasts. This transformation cannot be undone. 
        These monsters stampede, changing their form constantly, 
        slaying and devouring all in their path, devouring the 
        flesh of those in their way to the bone in seconds, and 
        eventually, when left with no surviving targets, turn 
        upon themselves in a "cannibalistic orgy". This 
        transformation is seen by the Bosmer as a return to 
        the chaos of the Dawn Era they call the Ooze, a state 
        of existence where all life and land on Nirn were 
        formless and shifted constantly between shapes, unable 
        to hold one form for more than a moment.
