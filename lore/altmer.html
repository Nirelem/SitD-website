        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <b>Altmer</b>, or <b>High Elves</b>, are a tall, golden-skinned race, hailing from Summerset Isle.</p>
        <h2>Summary: </h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 250px;">
            <li><p>Generally viewed as proud or snobbish.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lifespan two to three times as long as humans.</p></li>
            <li><p>Affinity for the arcane arts.</p></li>
            <li><p>Resisatance to disease damage.</p></li>
            <li><p>But they are also vulnerable to magic.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            Every elven race can trace back their lineage to 
the ancient Aldmer of the lost continent of Aldmeris,
but it is believed that the Altmer are the most direct,
unaltered descendants of the Aldmer. 
Because of this, purity and preserving one's 
bloodline is important in the upper circles of 
Altmer society. This emphasis on
perfection, honor, and nobility reflects on every aspect of their society,
from their art and architecture to their arms and armor.
However, this obsession also has its darker sides. 
Over hundreds of generations, the High Elves attempt 
to breed themselves into a racially pure line. 
They do not reproduce as often or as quickly as humans
do. Incest is not uncommon, and it is said that 9 out of 
10 babies are discarded after being born, simply due to some
form of "defect". Altmeri names are simply combinations of 
numbers in their own language, and Altmer culture 
revolves around displaying social status.
<br><br>
Many Altmer of the Summerset Isles prefer to live an isolationist 
life on their idyllic shores, viewing themselves as superior and
more advanced, technologically and magically, compared to the other races.
Exile to the mainland is seen as equivalent to a death sentence. If you
are an Altmer from outside Summerset, you were either exiled there,
or were born in a family that, at one point, was originally from 
the Summerset Isles.
        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            The Altmer pantheon consists primarily of Aedra (which are like the 'gods' 
            in the Elder Scrolls and are the opposite of the Daedra).
            The Altmer believe that they are descended from the Aedra, and view them as their divine ancestors.
            The Altmer focus on their divine lineage and strive to emulate the purity 
            and greatness of their ancestors, believing themselves to be the closest 
            to the gods among the mortal races.

                    The chief deity, equivalent to Akatosh in other cultures' religion. 
                    Auri-El is the god of time, the king of the Aedra, and a symbol of Elven 
                    purity and their connection to divinity.

        <h2>The Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion</h2>
        <p>
            The Thalmor are the ruling political organization of the Aldmeri Dominion, which both
            came about in the early Fourth Era. They are an elitist 
            and authoritarian group of Altmer who believe in the superiority of the Elven races and seek 
            to restore their ancient dominance over Tamriel. 
            <br><br>
            This political party has existed for most of 
            the Altmer's history, but they were usually just a very small party and only represented a minority 
            of society. However, much like how the Nazi party rose to power in our world, the Thalmor became 
            more and more popular after Summerset was beset by crises and turmoil, following the <a href="oblivioncrisis.html">
            Oblivion Crisis</a> from <i>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>.
            At the turn of the Fourth Era was the rise of the Thalmor, who instituted a policy of persecution 
            and even open slaughter of dissidents and non-Elven races in Summerset. Numerous surviving Altmer dissidents 
            were forced to flee to other parts of Tamriel, where they were frequently targeted by Thalmor assassins. 
            While many Altmer continue to disagree with the Thalmor in private, few venture to oppose them publicly.
            <br><br>
            The Thalmor are infamous for their efforts 
            to suppress Talos worship (God-Hero of Man and founder of the Empire), which they view as heretical due to their disdain for the divinization 
            of a human. They also hunt down anyone who expresses any form of dislike towards the Thalmor or the Aldmeri Dominion.
            Due to the reputationn of their strict rule and ruthless tactics, the Thalmor are 
            a major antagonist force in Tamriel's recent history. 
            <br><br>
            Their goals extend beyond political control, aiming to undo the creation of Mundus, which 
            they see as a flawed, mortal prison.
