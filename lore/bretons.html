        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            High Rock is fractious and divided politically, made of up of five major
            kingdoms in the present day. It used to be much more fragmented with
            dozens of minor kingdoms, and
            warfare between these kingdoms accounts for much of Breton history.
            Despite this, Bretons across the province share many facets of 
            culture, including language, bardic traditions, and heroic tales. 
            Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, magical elite, and ruling 
            families of the feudal kingdoms competing for power within High Rock, 
            but the race can also be found around the rest of Tamriel, often as 
            merchants or mercenaries.
            <br><br>
            The Breton race originated from the aboriginal human race, known as 
            <b>Nedes</b>, interbreeding with Altmer colonists that settled in the lands
            of modern High Rock. This particular group of Altmer that would become
            ingrained in High Rock are known as <b>Clan Direnni</b>. The Direnni 
            left a significant mark on the Bretons. The race's obsession 
            with nobility, status, and lineage can be traced back to their 
            days as vassals of Clan Direnni. After millennia of interbreeding,
            the humanistic features of the Bretons slowly overpowered their elven
            features. In the present day, Clan Direnni is but a small and minor group
            found only in the tiny <a href="../provinces/cities/highrock_markers/balfiera.html">Isle of Balfiera</a>, while the Bretons have
            replaced them as the rulers of what is now High Rock.
            <br><br>
            Bretons possess an inborn 
            and instinctive bond for the magical arts, often attributed to 
            their elven blood. They are known for their intelligence and 
            have a quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, enchantment, 
            and alchemy. Magic permeates throughout all of Breton society, 
            from the serf all the way up to the king; the average Breton 
            mage is said to perform "flamboyant gesticulations" when 
            spellcasting.
            <br><br>

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            Bretons primarily worship the <a href="imperials.html">Imperial</a> pantheon of the 
            <b>Eight Divines</b>, but some still worship certain elven deities, which are an 
            influence from the time of Clan Direnni.
            <h3>Eight Divines</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><p><b>Akatosh:</b>
                    Akatosh, known as Auri-El to the elves, is the Dragon God of Time and chief deity of the Divines. He represents endurance, 
                    stability, and the passage of time and is revered as the father of dragons and a symbol of the Empire’s legitimacy.

        <h2>Knightly Orders</h2>
        <p>
            Breton society is famous for its <b>knightly orders</b>, with 
            notable examples including Daggerfall's Knights of the 
            Dragon, the Knights of the Rose of Wayrest, the Knights 
            of the Flame of Anticlere, and Dwynnen's Order of the Raven.
            High Rock's cultural history is founded on tales of such noble 
            and chivalrous knights. The knightly orders were founded to 
            carry on the tradition of nobles-in-arms and to ensure the 
            province would have defenders at the ready should invading 
            armies come to their gates. Knights are addressed with the 
            honor of "sir" or "dame." In most cases, these knightly orders 
            are governed by a marshal or a knight-commander.
        </p>
    <h2>Druids</h2>
    <p>
        When the Breton race was still new and emerging, <b>druids</b> were the
        first to lead them. Druidic spellcraft became the first truly 
        Breton creation, and "druid" as a distinct identity was fully 
        realized. These druids believe in the Breton's ability to enhance 
        or perfect nature.
        <br><br>
        Somewhere along the line, a split occurred among these druids, and
        eventually the witch covens of <b>the Wyrd</b> diverged from the True Way 
        in a religious schism. While the druids revere nature, they 
        were not keen to isolate themselves and worship the untamed 
        wilds. Therein lies the primary difference in culture 
        between druids and the Wyrd: the Wyrd abandoned civilization 
        in favor of living in the wilds, and believe that they are nature itself.
        In contrast, druids accepted what they interpreted as their "proper 
        place" as people, and embraced the idea that civilization 
        can coexist alongside nature. The druids found the ways of the 
        Wyrd unsavory, and the Wyrd thought the druids were no better 
        than city-dwellers.
